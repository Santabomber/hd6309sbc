This set of design files implements the PCB for the HD6309 Singleboard Computer v1.0

Design tool is Protel DX SE

PCB was designed with hand-soldering in mind, and to my own set of (largely unwritten) PCB
design rules. After more than 25 years of doing PCB layouts, I just sort of 'wing it'. As such,
the lands may be a bit elongated or otherwise non-IPC-ish. I also favor 0805 and 0603 passives, 
again in an attempt to enable easy hand-assembly.

My PCB were fabricated by OSHpark https://oshpark.com/ with no issues identified during
build-up.
