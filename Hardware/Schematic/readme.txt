This set of design files implements the PCB for the HD6309 Singleboard Computer v1.0

Design tool is Cadence (Orcad)

The circuit was designed to maximize use of POS ("Parts On Shelf") and not necessarily
to use the best device possible for a given function. That being said, I think that the
choice of the Zilog SCC is a good choice for serial coms, much better than the default
choice of MC6850. On the other hand, I like the Zilog CIO a lot because of the integration
it offers (much better than an MC6821, for example) but it is weird, and not so commonplace.
